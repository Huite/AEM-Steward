This supplementary educational material is provided for the book, "Analytic Element Method: Complex Interactions of Boundaries and Interfaces" by David R. Steward (2020).  It contains text files containing computer code that implements many of the examples and illustrations using the equations presented in the text.  

Code was developed to be used with Scilab, an Open source software for numerical computation, available at http://www.scilab.org

Each computer file contains code that will generate an illustration from the text.  Note that the file AEM_DRSteward_functions_visualize.sce contains functions to construct figures, and must be located in the scilab working directory associated with the variable PWD and the function pwd().  All files have been verified with Scilab version 6.1.0.
